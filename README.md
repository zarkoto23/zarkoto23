# 👋 Hello, I'm Svetozar — JavaScript Fullstack Developer in Training

I'm currently building a solid foundation in modern JavaScript development, focused on creating responsive, interactive, and well-structured Single Page Applications (SPAs).  
While my primary focus is frontend, I'm also diving into backend fundamentals with Node.js to become a fullstack JavaScript developer.

## 💻 Tech Stack & Experience

**Languages & Fundamentals**  
JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3, Git, Node.js (basics)

**Key Concepts & Practices**  
- Functional and modular programming (ES modules, reusable code structure)  
- DOM manipulation, event-driven architecture  
- Rendering dynamic content through template engines like `lit-html`  
- SPA architecture and client-side routing with `Page.js`  
- Asynchronous JavaScript: Promises, fetch, async/await  
- RESTful APIs and full CRUD workflows  
- Form validation, state management, local/session storage  
- Error handling and debugging strategies  
- Clean architecture and separation of logic from presentation  
- Testing: unit (`Mocha`, `Chai`) and end-to-end (`Playwright`)

**Tools & Workflow**  
VSCode, npm, Postman, GitHub Desktop, Chrome DevTools

## 🚀 Featured Projects

My repositories showcase both educational and personal projects built around SPA principles and modular architecture.  
They demonstrate:

- User authentication systems (register, login, logout)  
- Full CRUD operations with RESTful APIs  
- Dynamic rendering using templating libraries  
- Modular structure with separation of logic, views, and services  
- SPA routing with `Page.js` for seamless navigation  
- Responsive, mobile-first design  
- Project-based use of real testing tools: `Mocha`, `Chai`, `Playwright`  
- Emphasis on clean code, reusable components, and scalable structure  

Each repository includes a clear README file with:

- 📝 Project description and goals  
- 🛠️ Technologies used  
- 🔧 Setup instructions  
- 📷 Screenshots or demo links (if applicable)
